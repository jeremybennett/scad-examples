This directory contains various threaded entities using the OpenSCAD thread
and sweep library Rudolf Huttary (aka Parkinbot).

## Modifications to the libraries

I have modified the files `Naca_sweep.scad` and `Threading.scad` as follows:

1. I have added SPDX license identifiers to each file.

2. I have removed trailing whitespace.

3. I have commented out the call to example in `Threading.scad`

## Licensing

Unlike the rest of this repository, the thread and sweep libraries (the files
`Naca_sweep.scad`, `Threading.scad` and `Threads.stl`) are licensed under a
Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license. The file LICENSE.txt
is a reminder of this.
